## Designer-wannabe-socialscientist-developerâ€”a multipotentialite, really.
Hey I'm Kir! I currently work at [Lyon](https://lyon.com.ph/) as their Head of Design that does customer support and frontend development at the side too. I'm also an incoming freshman at [Ateneo de Manila University](https://www.ateneo.edu/) for the next school year, taking up BS Management Information Systems as my undergrad. 

When I'm not working my sockets off, I'm learning about a multitude of things that interests me at the time. They could be about social or natural science, current events, or arts such as film and video games in general. I like calling them as my "intellectual flings" if you will. 

Other than that, I may be seen going out with my friends or family. Or maybe I could be grinding in Elden Ring _smirk_

## My Interests
**They include**: literature, video games, social science, math, speculative fiction, arts, film, fashion, coffee, anime, tech, statistics, writing, comics, traveling, and many more under the sun.
