## About me
Hi! I'm Kir. I'm a design & ML engineer and a junior at Ateneo de Manila University currently taking BS Management Information Systems as my undergrad. I think a lot about human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and complex systems. Currently, I'm the President of [UX Society](https://uxsociety.org/).

In the past, I co-organized DT|UX Summit 2024 featuring Don Norman, the father of UX; was mentored by Christian San Jose, the founder and CEO of UX+ University, for UX Design; worked as the founding designer of two SaaS startups at 17; and won a regional science and technology fair for a mobile app.

When I'm not pushing pixels or code, I:
````
• Read and study about anything that interests me at the moment.
• Tinker with my personal knowledge management or productivity system.
• Write my stream of thoughts or play video games on my PS5.
• Go around the Metro to try out specialty coffee.
• Hang out with my family & friends.
