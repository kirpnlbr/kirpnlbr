## Designer-wannabe-socialscientist-developer—a multipotentialite, really.
Hey I'm Kir! I'm the Head of Design, sometimes Frontend Developer, and always the Customer Support at [Lyon](https://lyon.com.ph/). I'm an incoming freshman at [Ateneo de Manila University](https://www.ateneo.edu/) too, taking up BS Management Information Systems as my undergrad. 

In the past, I was mentored by [Christian San Jose](https://christiansanjose.com/) of [UX+ University](https://university.uxpl.us/) for UX Design; a regional science and technology fair winner for a mobile app and poster making; one of her high school batch's leader and creative; and a frustrated illustrator because she dabbled on too many things during her junior high school.

When I'm not working my sockets off, I'm either:
````
• Learning about a multitude of things that interests me at the moment. (See my "intellectual flings" below)
• Watching films and pretending to be a renowned reviewer at Letterboxd.
• Tasting the different cafe lattes of the coffee shops of Metro Manila.
• Reading short stories, text books, Sci-Fi or Japanese literature.
• Grinding in Elden Ring, or playing video games in general.
• Working on side projects, mostly on the creative side.
• Going out with my friends or family.

## My Intellectual Flings
````
Literature, video games, social science, math, speculative fiction, arts, film, fashion, coffee, anime, statistics,
tech, writing, comics, traveling, and many more under the sun.
