## About me
Hi! I'm Kir. I'm a design engineer and a sophomore at Ateneo de Manila University currently taking BS Management Information Systems as my undergrad. I'm enthusiastic about human-computer interaction, creative coding, game design, machine learning, and visual metaphors.

In the past, I was mentored by Christian San Jose, the founder and CEO of UX+ University, for UX Design; the founding designer of two SaaS startups when I was 17; a regional science and technology fair winner for a mobile app; and a student leader and creative.

When I'm not pushing pixels or code, I:
````
• Read and study about anything that interests me at the moment.
• Tinker with my personal knowledge management or productivity system.
• Write my stream of thoughts or play video games on my PS5.
• Go around the Metro to try out specialty coffee.
• Hang out with my family & friends.
